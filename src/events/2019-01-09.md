Ignite talks are 20 slides, auto-advancing every 15 seconds and only 5 minutes long. They can be on any topic. Ignite talks are a great chance to share ideas that wouldn't typically take up a full talk. It's also a way to dip your toe into public speaking (anyone can bomb for 5 minutes). Here's the expected lineup.

- Chris Parich on “Things I didn’t know I hate about C++”
- Davin Smith on “Serverless FizzBuzz: An Infinitely scalable FizzBuzz Solution in AWS”
- Alexander Songe on “Why you should use ZFS"
- Zach Byerly on “High Performance Computing"
- Steven Musumeche on “GraphQL"
- Corey Gaudin on "Servant Leadership: What is it and why is it important?"
- Tre King on “Docker for Enterprise”
- Andy Dye on "A Resume Talk"
