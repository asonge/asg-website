The theory of navigation using landmarks, obstacle avoidance, feature detection, and geomagnetic heading are all well and good for simulated worlds, but everything changes once you have to rely on physical measurements to navigate. Chris will walk through the real-world problems of different kinds of sensors, and some of the ways we try to solve or reduce the errors they cause.
