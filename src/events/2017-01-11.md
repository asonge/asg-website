Ignite talks are 20 slides, auto-advancing every 15 seconds and only 5 minutes long. They can be on any topic. Ignite talks are a great chance to share ideas that wouldn't typically take up a full talk. It's also a way to dip your toe into public speaking (anyone can bomb for 5 minutes). Here's the expected lineup.

- Chris Parich on "How to fail spectacularly at Java encryption"
- Demian Neidetcher on "Brain Optimization"
- Geoff Daily on "Computers are Smart, Users are Stupid: So What Are You Going to Do About It?"
- Raymond Camden on "Growing Your Family Through Adoption"
- Brian Stanford on "Knowing Your Audience"
