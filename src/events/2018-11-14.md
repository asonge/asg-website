talkTitle: "Creating Reusable Libraries in Angular 6"

A common challenge for software developers is figuring out how to extract reusable code from their applications so that the same features and functionality can be used across multiple applications. In some cases, it may be desirable to release the code as an open source library or module such that the wider community can contribute improvements and bug fixes. In other cases, it may be preferable to host the code in a private repository owned by the organization, while still aiming for a similar goal: reuse and collaboration across teams or projects.

While it has always been possible to create reusable libraries in Angular, the release of Angular 6 in May of this year introduces new features that make it easier than ever before. This presentation will walk through the basic process of building a library within a project, and leveraging the features of the library in the application code. The presentation will then go a step further by discussing how this library can be deployed as a standalone npm module. Various options for deploying the module to the open source community or via a private npm repository such as Verdaccio or Artifactory will be covered.
