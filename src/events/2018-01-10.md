Ignite talks are 20 slides, auto-advancing every 15 seconds and only 5 minutes long. They can be on any topic. Ignite talks are a great chance to share ideas that wouldn't typically take up a full talk. It's also a way to dip your toe into public speaking (anyone can bomb for 5 minutes). Here's the expected lineup.

- Gustave Lamperes on "This is Paddling"
- Andy Dye on "Effective Resumes"
- Charles LeDoux on "How not to do security"
- Heather Ré Doucet on "How to Land Your Dream Job"
- Benjamin Anding on "Composing an Enterprise Blockchain Ledger"
- Davin Smith on "Design is CRAP"
- Alexander Songe on "The End of Computer Science"
- Geoff Daily on "How to Save Lafayette’s Economy"
